# Custom Permalinks

## Description

Lay out your site the way *you* want it. Set the URL of any post, page, tag or category to anything you want.
Old permalinks will redirect properly to the new address.  Custom Permalinks gives you ultimate control
over your site structure.

Be warned: *This plugin is not a replacement for WordPress's built-in permalink system*. Check your WordPress
administration's "Permalinks" settings page first, to make sure that this doesn't already meet your needs.

This plugin is only useful for assigning custom permalinks for *individual* posts, pages, tags or categories.
It will not apply whole permalink structures or automatically apply a category's custom permalink to the posts
within that category.

> If anyone wants the different Structure Tags for their Post types or use symbols in the URLs So, use the [Permalinks Customizer](https://wordpress.org/plugins/permalinks-customizer/) which is a fork of this plugin and contains the enhancement of this plugin.

## Filters

To exclude any Permalink to processed with the plugin so, just add the filter looks like this:
```
function yasglobal_xml_sitemap_url( $permalink ) {
  if ( false !== strpos( $permalink, 'sitemap.xml' )) {
    return '__true';
  }
  return;
}
add_filter( 'custom_permalinks_request_ignore', 'yasglobal_xml_sitemap_url' );
```

To exclude permalink from any post type so, just add the filter looks like this:
```
function yasglobal_exclude_post_types( $post_type ) {
  if ( $post_type == 'custompost' ) {
    return '__true';
  }
  return '__false';
}
add_filter( 'custom_permalinks_exclude_post_type', 'yasglobal_exclude_post_types');
```
Note: `custom_permalinks_exclude_post_type` doesn't work on the posts permalink which has been created previously.

To remove the like query to being work just add this line in your theme's functions.php:
```
add_filter( 'cp_remove_like_query', '__return_false');
```
Note: Use `custom_permalinks_like_query` filter if the URLs doesn't works for you after upgrading to v1.2.9
