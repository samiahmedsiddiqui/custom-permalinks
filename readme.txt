Custom Permalinks is a powerful WordPress plugin that grants you complete control over your site's URLs. Easily set unique, custom permalinks for any post, page, tag, or category, allowing you to design an ideal site structure. It includes features for defining post type-specific structures with dynamic tags and automatically redirects old URLs to your new custom ones. Developers can also leverage a wide array of filters for advanced customization.

== Description ==

You want to take control of your WordPress site's URLs? The **Custom Permalinks** plugin gives you the power to set unique, custom URLs for any post, page, tag, or category. This means you can design your site's structure exactly how you envision it, rather than being limited by WordPress's default settings. When you set a custom permalink, the original post URL will be automatically redirected to your new, customized URL.

=== Key Features ===

* **Individual Permalink Control**: Assign unique URLs to any post, page, tag, or category.
* **Site Structure Control**: Gain ultimate control over how your site's URLs are organized.
* **Post Type Permalink Structures (v3.0.0+)**: Define custom permalink structures for each public Post Type using predefined tags, automatically generating URLs upon content creation. You can still manually edit any permalink. If left empty, default settings will apply.

=== Getting Started: Plugin Settings ===

You can configure Custom Permalinks by navigating to **Settings \> Custom Permalinks** in your WordPress Dashboard.

=== Available Tags for Permalink Structures ===

When setting up your custom permalink structures, you can use a variety of tags that will dynamically populate the URL. Here's a breakdown of what's available:

* **%year%**: The year of the post in four digits, eg: 2025
* **%monthnum%**: Month the post was published, in two digits, eg: 01
* **%day%**: Day the post was published in two digits, eg: 02
* **%hour%**: Hour of the day, the post was published, eg: 15
* **%minute%**: Minute of the hour, the post was published, eg: 43
* **%second%**: Second of the minute, the post was published, eg: 33
* **%post_id%**: The unique ID of the post, eg: 123
* **%category%**: A clean version of the category name (its slug). Nested sub-categories will appear as nested directories in the URL..
* **%author%**: A sanitized version of the post authorâ€™s name.
* **%postname%**: A clean version of the post or page title (its slug). For example, "This Is A Great Post\!" becomes `this-is-a-great-post` in the URL.
* **%parent_postname%**: Similar to `%postname%`, but uses the immediate parent page's slug if a parent is selected.
* **%parents_postnames%**: Similar to `%postname%`, but includes all parent page slugs if parents are selected.
* **%title%**: The title of the post, converted to a slug. For example, "This Is A Great Post\!" becomes `this-is-a-great-post`. Unlike `%postname%` which is set once, `%title%` automatically updates in the permalink if the post title changes (unless the post is published or the permalink is manually edited).
* **%ctax_TAXONOMY_NAME%**: A clean version of a custom taxonomy's name. Replace `TAXONOMY_NAME` with the actual taxonomy name. You can also provide a default slug for when no category/taxonomy is selected by using `??` (e.g., `%ctax_type??sales%` will use "sales" as a default).
* **%ctax_parent_TAXONOMY_NAME%**: Similar to `%ctax_TAXONOMY_NAME%`, but includes the immediate parent category/tag slug in the URL if a parent is selected.
* **%ctax_parents_TAXONOMY_NAME%**: Similar to `%ctax_TAXONOMY_NAME%`, but includes all parent category/tag slugs in the URL if parents are selected.
* **%custom_permalinks_TAG_NAME%**: Developers have the flexibility to define their own custom tags(replace `_TAG_NAME` with your desired name). To ensure these tags resolve to the correct permalinks, simply apply the `custom_permalinks_post_permalink_tag` filter.

**Important Note:** For new posts, Custom Permalinks will keep updating the permalink while the post is in draft mode, assuming a structure is defined in the plugin settings. Once the post is published or its permalink is manually updated, the plugin will stop automatic updates for that specific post.
